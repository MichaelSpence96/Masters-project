# Masters Project
This repository contains the code written in the course of completing my masters thesis. Part of this project consisted in working out numbers known as symmetry factors associated to Feynman diagrams which represent the scattering of fundamental particles. It turns out that these numbers can be evaluated using a kind of mathematics known as representations theory, specifically the representation theory of the symmetric group. This requires the manipulation of Young tableaux in order to generate rational matrices representing permutations of objects. The most important part of the program is an implementation of the Garnir algorithm. This is a combinatoric algorithm for the manipulation of tableaux which is great use in representation theory.
